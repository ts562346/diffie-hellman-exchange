# diffie-hellman-exchange

Emulate Diffie Hellman exchange in software by writing a small program that accepts the values of p and g, and randomly generates the secret numbers SA and SB, and derives the Diffie Hellman secret. 

Test your program for the following three examples: 

a. p = 11, g = 13
b. p = 7, g = 17
c. p = 17, g = 13

Notes: 
1) Do not hard code the input values p and g. Accept it as user input via the console.
2) Document your code with minimal comments at the least
